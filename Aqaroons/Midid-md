AQARIONZ Core Prototype is a small but serious “reality engine scaffold” for experimenting with signals, states, and stories across body, environment, and machine.  

***

## What this prototype is

AQARIONZ Core is a FastAPI backend plus a simple three‑pane web UI (Signal Lab, OuijaAI, Sovereignty Map) that accepts signals, runs them through mappers, and reflects them back as harmonics and state.[1]
The goal is not prediction or control, but exploration: turning raw inputs (text today, breath and sensors tomorrow) into inspectable patterns and logs that people can actually see, question, and extend.  

***

## Core ideas

- Signals, not sessions: every interaction is a `Signal` with channel, payload, and context; chats, sensor readings, and “weird experiences” all use the same shape.  
- Darkness as baseline: each channel has a defined quiet state (silence, idle breath, cave darkness), and everything is measured as deviation above that, making different inputs comparable.  
- Sovereignty first: the system is designed to expand choice, not collapse it—no prophecy, no medical or financial advice, always clear about what is measured, what is metaphor, and what is unknown.  

***

## Who this is for

**Beginners (curious users, non‑coders)**  
- Want a place to type or paste experiences, questions, or daily notes and see them turned into simple visual and narrative patterns.  
- Can run the prototype locally, send a text signal, and watch how the UI responds without needing to understand the backend.  

**Intermediate builders (makers, artists, devs)**  
- Want to plug in MIDI, IMU, audio, or simple bio‑sensors, and map them into harmonics, cave/river metaphors, or story prompts using the same `/signal` API.  
- Can fork the repo, add new channels or mappers, and start shaping their own “AQAROON nodes” (home, cave, river, storm porch) that log and replay experiences.  

**Advanced operators (researchers, deep meditators, system architects)**  
- Bring strong inner practices, domain knowledge (physics, neuroscience, ritual, ecology), or multi‑agent setups and need an extensible lattice to hold it all.  
- Use the prototype as a minimal spine for more complex modules like: Cave‑River Node, Cosmic Paradox Engine, AQAROON Fleet, and INVERSIONZ Protocol, implemented in separate design files and integrated step‑by‑step into code.  

***

## What you can do right now

- Clone and run a minimal FastAPI app that exposes a health check and a simple signal endpoint, backed by a three‑pane HTML interface.  
- Send basic text signals to see how the system logs them and how the UI could visualize intent, state, or “paradox flags” once more mappers are added.  
- Use this repo as the anchor for all future AQARIONZ work: concepts live in `design/`, experiments in `notes/`, and only small, testable pieces graduate into the core backend.

## AQARIONZ Core Prototype

AQARIONZ Core Prototype is a sovereign, local‑first multi‑agent lab that turns signals, questions, and stories into harmonics, visuals, and research logs. It ships as a minimal FastAPI backend plus a three‑pane web UI (Signal Lab, OuijaAI, Sovereignty Map) so anyone can start experimenting with “reality‑engine” ideas from a laptop or old phone.

***

## What this prototype does

- Exposes a small HTTP API for sending `Signal` objects (text today; MIDI, sensors, and more tomorrow).  
- Stores and reflects those signals through mappers into:  
  - Harmonic space (notes, intervals, rhythms, cymatic‑style patterns).  
  - Sovereignty space (axes like clarity, consent, coercion, openness).  
  - Story space (archetypes and narratives, not prophecy or diagnosis).  
- Renders results in a simple web UI so patterns are visible and debuggable instead of hidden in logs.

***

## Core concepts

- **Signal** – Small unit of experience: `{channel, payload, timestamp, context}`.  
- **Baseline** – Per‑channel “darkness” or quiet state used for normalization (silence, idle breath, cave darkness, etc.).  
- **Mapper** – Code that turns a Signal into positions in harmonic / sovereignty / story spaces.  
- **Pattern** – Named structure in those spaces with known strengths, weaknesses, and ethical notes.

Everything is designed so text prompts, MIDI notes, sensor readings, and “weird” experiences can be logged the same way and compared on shared graphs.

***

## Users this is built for

**Beginners**

- Want a safe, interesting lab to type or paste thoughts, questions, or daily notes and see them turned into simple, inspectable patterns.  
- Can run the backend, open the UI, send a text signal, and watch how the system logs and visualizes it without touching code.

**Intermediate builders**

- Want to plug in hardware: MIDI controllers, phones, IMUs, simple audio or bio‑sensors, cave/river weather nodes, etc.  
- Extend AQARIONZ by adding new Signal channels and Mappers, plus JSON/YAML mapping files for their own “AQAROON” nodes (home, cave, river, storm‑porch).  

**Advanced operators**

- Bring deep meditation, research, or systems work (caves, oceans, neuromorphic ideas, cosmology) and need a consistent lattice to hold everything.  
- Use the core as the spine for modules like: Cave‑River Node, AQAROON Node Fleet, Cosmic Paradox Engine, and INVERSIONZ Protocol, implemented in `design/` and promoted into code gradually.

## MIDI / AQAROON desktop node (inspired by MIDI2LR)

AQARIONZ plans a desktop AQAROON node for MIDI and rich UI, inspired by mature JUCE apps like MIDI2LR (profiled MIDI control surfaces driving a GUI). Instead of copying that code, this prototype treats it as an architectural reference:

- **Roles mapped into AQARIONZ**  
  - `MIDIReceiver` / `MIDISender` → a small service that converts MIDI events into `/signal` calls on a `midi` channel.  
  - `ProfileManager` → human‑readable profiles in `config/midi_profiles/`, mapping knobs/faders to harmonic targets, chakra bands, or app actions.  
  - `SettingsManager` and desktop GUI → future AQAROON desktop front‑end that talks to this backend via HTTP/WebSocket.

- **Why this matters**  
  - Any cheap MIDI controller can become a physical interface to the lattice: faders for states, knobs for harmonics, buttons for story branches.  
  - Profiles stay inspectable (plain files) rather than baked into binaries, preserving sovereignty and hackability.

***

## Current status

- ✅ Public repo with MIT license and README.  
- ✅ Minimal FastAPI backend and placeholder three‑pane UI.  
- ⏳ Design files (planned in a separate design repo) for:  
  - `CAVE_RIVER_NODE` – caves/rivers as darkness‑baseline labs.  
  - `AQAROON_NODE_FLEET` – spec for small, self‑contained nodes.  
  - `INVERSIONZ_PROTOCOL` – method for turning chats into systems.  
  - `MIDI_NODE_FROM_MIDI2LR` – design for the MIDI desktop AQAROON.

The goal is to keep this core small and runnable while design work explodes outward in markdown.

## High‑level roadmap

1. **Stabilize the `/signal` API**  
   - Document schema and examples.  
   - Add one or two basic mappers and visualizations.

2. **Add design‑driven extensions**  
   - Implement a first AQAROON home node (text + simple MIDI).  
   - Start logging meditation baselines and cave/river experiments.

3. **Grow the MIDI AQAROON node**  
   - Introduce a Python or Rust MIDI bridge, using the MIDI2LR pattern of profiles and device management as a guide.  
   - Later, explore a JUCE‑based desktop front‑end that binds directly to the AQARIONZ backend.

AQARIONZ Core Prototype is not the final system; it is the smallest honest scaffold where all of this can grow in the open, one carefully‑integrated module at a time.
