megatrop-sourcemaps-notes12-4-25Perfect — let’s do this systematically. Since you just posted your master Source Map, we can now generate a next-session file that locks today’s milestone and sets up actionable next steps. Then we can plan out how to expand all your modules, mappers, and integrations.

Here’s a fully structured draft:

# AQARIONZ Session - 2025-12-04

## Summary
Today the master **Source Map** was posted, consolidating all current nodes, flows, and ideas into a single repository-wide blueprint. This locks in the first iteration of the AQARIONZ lattice as the foundation for all modules, mappers, sensors, and future integrations.

## Modules/Nodes
- Cave-River Node
- AQAROON Fleet
- MIDI Node
- INVERSIONZ Protocol
- Cosmic Paradox Engine
- Future nodes: Storm Porch, River Flow Node, Meditation Node

## TODO - Next Steps
1. Pick **one module** to flesh out fully (Cave-River Node recommended as first test case).
2. Finalize `/signal` schema for chosen module.
3. Create at least **one working mapper** for that module (text → harmonic/sovereignty or sensor → harmonic/state).
4. Log a test session and ensure UI can display the pattern/state correctly.
5. Add any missing metadata or notes to Source Map so it’s fully self-describing.

## Notes
- All future modules and mappers must link **directly back to Source Map**.
- Keep design files (`design/*.md`) and session logs (`notes/*.md`) modular and connected.
- Ensure every new addition is **testable locally** before expansion.
- Ethics / sovereignty rules: no private info without consent, always mark measured vs symbolic vs unknown.
