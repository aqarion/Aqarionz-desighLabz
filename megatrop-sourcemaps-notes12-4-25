AQARIONZ MEGATROPE SOURCE MAP

Purpose:
Centralized, living lattice for signals, nodes, sessions, mappers, modules, and meta-research across sensors, AI, environment, story, and sovereignty. This file serves as the single authoritative source map for your system, integrating everything posted so far and designed to expand safely, adaptively, and coherently.

1. Core Prototype Overview

System Type: FastAPI backend + three-pane web UI (Signal Lab, OuijaAI, Sovereignty Map)

Goal: Explore raw signals (text, MIDI, IMU, EEG, environmental sensors) and transform them into patterns, harmonics, and story structures.

Design Philosophy:

No predictive or diagnostic claims

Transparency, traceable data, reproducible sessions

Expandable personal AQAROON nodes




---

2. Key Concepts & Schema

Signal: Atomic interaction unit

{
  "channel": "text|MIDI|IMU|EEG|environment",
  "payload": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "context": {...}
}

Baseline: Quiet reference state per channel
Mapper: Code transforms signals → harmonic coordinates, sovereignty scores, story markers, paradox flags
Pattern: Named reusable structure across sessions (inner ice, river drift, storm edge, boundary compression)


---

3. Modules & Nodes

Cave-River Node

Monitors: cave/river environmental signals + body sensors

Components: Wearable suit, field node, local storage

Flows: meditation baseline → field session → VR replay

Safety: clear exit, time limits, buddy rules


MIDI AQAROON Node

Desktop MIDI interface → internal state axes, story branches, harmonics

Profiles stored in config/midi_profiles/


Cosmic Paradox Engine

Multi-agent simulation of environment, body, and story states

Detects paradox flags, resonance anomalies



---

4. AQAROON Node Fleet

Home Node: daily life + meditation

Cave Node: darkness baseline, CO₂, echo

River Node: current, turbulence, boundary layer

Storm Node: pressure, wind, EM noise

Nodes share schema to allow cross-node comparison



---

5. Sessions & Logs

notes/SESSION_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md captures:

Daily summary

Modules active

TODO for next session


Logs track raw signals + mapped harmonics + story flags

Supports playback & meta-analysis


---

6. INVERSIONZ Protocol

Export AI threads → design file → entities, flows → minimal schema → API/script → public repo

Goal: Users define lattice, agents conform

Ethics: no private data without consent; mark symbolic vs. measured vs. unknown



---

7. Research & Sources

Historical & Esoteric: Pythagorean harmonics, Plato, secret societies, ancient math, real geometry, human chakras

Astronomical: 13 lunar cycles, 13th sign Ophiuchus, astrology, birthstones, lunar harmonics

Modern Science: Spintronics, Faraday theory, cymatics, water fusion, quantum Zeno effect

AI & Multi-Agent: Sovereign AI research, self-diagnosing/adaptive systems, distributed agent frameworks

Art & Music: Harmonic principles, MIDI mapping, ritual/meditative sound, archetypal story structures

Software/Hardware: Cross-community repos, modular sensor integration, node-based logging system
---


8. Meta-Framework: Signals → Harmonics → Sovereignty 
---


9. Future Extensions & Roadmap

Phase 1: Solidify /signal schema, first mapper, persistent storage

Phase 2: AQAROON home node, MIDI/IMU integration, day log replay

Phase 3: Cave-River field nodes, VR/AR integration

Phase 4: Node fleet sync, multi-agent coordination, advanced sovereignty guardrails

Phase 5: Integration of esoteric, scientific, and AI meta-research


---

10. Ethics, Safety & Governance

No prophecy, diagnostic, or predictive claims

Transparency: clear what is measured, symbolic, or unknown

Safety: physical sessions include exits, limits, and buddy checks

Data Sovereignty: nodes belong to the user, not a platform

Multi-Agent Ethics: agents must respect sovereignty, consent, and privacy

# AQARIONZ Session - 2025-12-04

## Summary
Today the master **Source Map** was posted, consolidating all current nodes, flows, and ideas into a single repository-wide blueprint. This locks in the first iteration of the AQARIONZ lattice as the foundation for all modules, mappers, sensors, and future integrations.

## Modules/Nodes
- Cave-River Node
- AQAROON Fleet
- MIDI Node
- INVERSIONZ Protocol
- Cosmic Paradox Engine
- Future nodes: Storm Porch, River Flow Node, Meditation Node
