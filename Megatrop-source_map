AQARIONZ MEGATRON SOURCE MAP v2.0

Purpose:
Unified, self-adapting lattice connecting human, environmental, and digital signals with multi-agent AI, sovereignty principles, modular nodes, and phenomenological/metaphorical data. Designed for integration, extension, and live operation.

1. Core Architecture

1.1 Backbone Layers

Layer	Role	Data / Function

Signal Layer	Atomic unit of interaction	text, bio-signals, MIDI, IMU, environmental sensors, story/meta signals
Baseline Layer	Quiet/reference state	Cave darkness, river silence, heart rest, zero-input MIDI
Mapper Layer	Transform signals	Harmonics, sovereignty scores, story markers, paradox flags
Pattern Layer	Aggregate/reusable behaviors	Increasing resonance, inner ice, boundary compression, river drift, storm edge
Node Layer	Physical/digital deployment	Home, Cave, River, Storm, MIDI AQAROON
Multi-Agent Layer	AI orchestration	Sovereign agents, self-diagnosing, adaptive, plugin-ready

    "pattern_detected": "string",
    "paradox_flag": true|false
  }
}

3. Nodes & Deployment

Node	Hardware	Software	Role

Home	Laptop/RPi	AQARIONZ Core	Daily life signals, meditation, baseline testing
Cave	Sensors: IMU, CO₂, barometer	Core + Cave Module	Darkness baseline, boundary experiments
River	Sensors: flow, temp, sound	Core + River Module	Environmental patterns and story sync
Storm Porch	Sensors: wind, pressure, EM	Core + Storm Module	Extreme state logging, paradox triggers
MIDI	MIDI controller	Core + Mapper	Physical interface to harmonics, story arcs, sovereignty adjustments


Node Communication:

Multi-agent synchronization via encrypted, self-sovereign channels.

Publish/subscribe model: nodes push raw signals; multi-agent AI maps them.

Local logs ensure autonomy and privacy.



---

4. Multi-Agent AI Layer

Roles:

Signal Interpreter Agent: transforms raw input → patterns, harmonics, story markers

Sovereignty Agent: monitors choice, consent, and paradox flags

Self-Diagnosis Agent: checks mapper fidelity, detects drift, auto-corrects

Plugin Agent: negotiates new data sources or nodes safely

Paradox Reflection Agent: monitors Pinocchio paradox states in AI-human interactions


Communication Protocol:

gRPC/WebSocket between agents

Heartbeat + health checks

Immediate propagation of paradox flags to Sovereignty Agent



---

5. Patterns & Harmonics

Pattern	Description	Example Signals

Increasing Resonance	Amplification of aligned signals	MIDI note + breath + story text
Inner Ice	Calm baseline vs environmental stress	Heart rate drop + cave darkness
Boundary Compression	Signal exceeding node boundary	CO₂ spike + EM turbulence
River Drift	Flow alignment	Environmental sensors + IMU movement
Storm Edge	Extreme state	Wind + EM + paradox flag


Harmonics Mapping:

Pythagorean ratios for frequency patterns

Map bio-signals to 13-lunar cycles & 13th zodiac archetype (Ophiuchus/Serpent Bearer)

Real geometry calibration for resonance & pattern detection

Session File Example:

# SESSION_2025-12-04
Summary: Integrated Cave-River Node signals with first multi-agent AI mapping.
Modules active: Cave-River Node, AQAROON Fleet, MIDI Node
TODO:
- Finalize mapper calibration
- Add River Node environmental sync
- Test plugin registration


---

7. Security & Sovereignty

Local-first architecture: nodes retain raw signals; AI processes sanitized/mapped data

Plugin registration: whitelist-only, auto-audit, signatures checked

Data sovereignty: user owns logs, signals, derived patterns

Fallback protocols: offline operation, safe sync when possible



---

8. Integration & Expansion Options

Hardware: IoT, MIDI, EEG, IMU, environmental probes

Software: FastAPI backend, WebSocket multi-agent bus, mapper scripts

Research Integration: 13 lunar cycles, chakras, cymatics, spintronics, Faraday principles, quantum Zeno

Community Knowledge: open design docs for pattern sharing, plugin submission, multi-agent federation



---

9. Future Megamodules

Cosmic Paradox Engine

Quantum Freeze / Zeno Multi-Agent Layer

Self-Extending Mapper AI

INVERSIONZ Protocol v2 (system-wide transformation)

Immersive VR/AR signal reflection
