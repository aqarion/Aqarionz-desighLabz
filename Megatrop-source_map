3. Nodes & Deployment

Node	Hardware	Software	Role

Home	Laptop/RPi	AQARIONZ Core	Daily life signals, meditation, baseline testing
Cave	Sensors: IMU, CO₂, barometer	Core + Cave Module	Darkness baseline, boundary experiments
River	Sensors: flow, temp, sound	Core + River Module	Environmental patterns and story sync
Storm Porch	Sensors: wind, pressure, EM	Core + Storm Module	Extreme state logging, paradox triggers
MIDI	MIDI controller	Core + Mapper	Physical interface to harmonics, story arcs, sovereignty adjustments


Node Communication:

Multi-agent synchronization via encrypted, self-sovereign channels.

Publish/subscribe model: nodes push raw signals; multi-agent AI maps them.

Local logs ensure autonomy and privacy.



---

4. Multi-Agent AI Layer

Roles:

Signal Interpreter Agent: transforms raw input → patterns, harmonics, story markers

Sovereignty Agent: monitors choice, consent, and paradox flags

Self-Diagnosis Agent: checks mapper fidelity, detects drift, auto-corrects

Plugin Agent: negotiates new data sources or nodes safely

Paradox Reflection Agent: monitors Pinocchio paradox states in AI-human interactions


Communication Protocol:

gRPC/WebSocket between agents

Heartbeat + health checks

Immediate propagation of paradox flags to Sovereignty Agent

5. Patterns & Harmonics

Pattern	Description	Example Signals

Increasing Resonance	Amplification of aligned signals	MIDI note + breath + story text
Inner Ice	Calm baseline vs environmental stress	Heart rate drop + cave darkness
Boundary Compression	Signal exceeding node boundary	CO₂ spike + EM turbulence
River Drift	Flow alignment	Environmental sensors + IMU movement
Storm Edge	Extreme state	Wind + EM + paradox flag


Harmonics Mapping:

Pythagorean ratios for frequency patterns

Map bio-signals to 13-lunar cycles & 13th zodiac archetype (Ophiuchus/Serpent Bearer)

Real geometry calibration for resonance & pattern detection

7. Security & Sovereignty

Local-first architecture: nodes retain raw signals; AI processes sanitized/mapped data

Plugin registration: whitelist-only, auto-audit, signatures checked

Data sovereignty: user owns logs, signals, derived patterns

Fallback protocols: offline operation, safe sync when possible



---

This is one single master file. It integrates:

All nodes, signals, patterns

Multi-agent AI orchestration

Session tracking

Security/sovereignty principles

Future Expansion pathways
Ah, perfect — understood. You want a fully updated, integrated Megatron Source Map for AQARIONZ before doing any further web search or expansion. No fluff, all professional, everything tied together from the previous design files, modules, and architectural concepts.

Here’s the updated source map based on your repo, previous sessions, and all your modules, tied into a single cohesive framework:

AQARIONZ – Megatron Source Map (v2.1 Integrated)

Purpose

A unified blueprint for AQARIONZ, bridging all current design docs, modules, metaphors, and planned runtime components into one actionable reference. Supports multi-agent AI orchestration, sovereignty-safe plugin architecture, and sensor/mapper integration.


---

1. Core Architecture

Modules / Nodes

Node	Function	Inputs	Outputs	Status

Cave-River Node	Environment baseline & signal calibration	Light, sound, humidity, CO₂	Normalized environment signals	Design ready
AQAROON Home Node	Personal baseline & pattern tracking	Text, MIDI, IMU	Harmonic + sovereignty coordinates	Design ready
MIDI Node	Controller mapping to harmonic / story axes	MIDI hardware	Control signals for UI, harmonics	Prototype planned
INVERSIONZ Protocol	Paradox detection, signal inversion, pattern exploration	Signals, mappers	Reflected / inverted patterns	Design ready
Cosmic Paradox Engine	Meta-pattern orchestration, multi-node synthesis	All signals	Composite metaphysical patterns	Conceptual


Core Concepts

Signal: Atomic input unit

{
    "channel": "text|midi|cave|river",
    "payload": "...",
    "timestamp": "...",
    "context": {...}
}

Baseline: Quiet state per channel; normalizes sensor input

Mapper: Transforms signals → harmonic, sovereignty, story coordinates

Pattern: Symbolic, reusable structures detected across signals



---

2. Multi-Agent Layer

Agent Types

Agent	Role

Signal Ingestor	Collects from all active nodes; validates against schema
Mapper Agent	Converts signals → harmonic/sovereignty/story outputs
Paradox Agent	Detects inversion or resonance conflicts (INVERSIONZ)
Coordinator Agent	Bridges nodes, enforces sovereignty rules, sync
Plugin Agent	Registers new modules/plugins; enforces permissions


Communication

All agents communicate via event bus (local-first, encrypted if remote)

Multi-agent orchestration ensures synchronous updates and parallel signal processing
